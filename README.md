### Abstract

Beta regressions are widely used for modeling rates, ratios and proportions. We study computational aspects related to parameter 
estimation of beta regressions by maximizing the log-likelihood function with heuristics and other optimization methods. 
Through Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the behavior of ten algorithms, where four of them  present satisfactory results: 
differential evolutionary,  simulated annealing,  stochastic ranking evolutionary,  and controlled random search, with the latter 
having the best performance.  Using the four algorithms and the <code>optim</code> function of <code>R</code>, we study sets 
of parameters that are hard to be estimated.
